 EpubRestructure is a tool designed to help restructure and reorganize EPUB files. It parses EPUB files, manipulates their contents (like chapters, metadata, etc.), and saves the updated file. The goal of this project is to simplify the process of modifying EPUB structures for various needs such as customization, optimization, or corrections.
